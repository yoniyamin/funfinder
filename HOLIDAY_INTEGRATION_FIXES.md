# Holiday Integration & Cache Fixes

## ✅ All Three Issues Resolved

### 🔧 **Issue 1: Cache Icon Disappeared**

**Root Cause**: Server wasn't properly returning `cacheInfo` metadata in API responses.

**Fix Applied**:
- **Server Response**: Added `cacheInfo: json.cacheInfo || null` to `/api/activities` endpoint
- **Cache Metadata**: Enhanced cached results to include proper `cacheInfo` object
- **Result Propagation**: Ensured cache info flows through entire response chain

**Now Working**: Lightning bolt ⚡ icon appears with tooltip showing cache type and similarity percentage.

### 🎭 **Issue 2: Holiday/Festival Integration** 

**Problem**: Separate holiday API calls weren't working reliably and weren't always enabled.

**Solution**: **Unified Holiday/Festival Context in Main Search**

#### **Integrated into Main Activity Search**:
- ✅ **Automatic Inclusion**: Holiday/festival info now part of every activity search
- ✅ **Enhanced Prompt**: AI considers holiday closures and festival-related activities
- ✅ **Smart Caching**: Festival data cached with date ranges for reuse
- ✅ **No Dependencies**: Works regardless of separate API settings

#### **Enhanced Search Prompt**:
```
HOLIDAYS & FESTIVALS CONTEXT:
The following holidays and festivals are happening around this date:
- Christmas Day (2025-12-25)
- Winter Festival (2025-12-23 to 2025-12-26)
Consider these when suggesting activities - some venues may be closed on holidays, 
or there may be special events related to festivals.
```

#### **Smart Context Flow**:
1. **Check Cache** → Look for festival data within date range  
2. **Fetch Fresh** → Get holiday/festival info if not cached
3. **Include in Prompt** → AI gets full context for better suggestions
4. **Cache Results** → Store for future searches with date range

**Business Logic Improvements**:
- **Holiday Awareness**: AI knows venues might be closed on public holidays
- **Festival Events**: Suggests activities related to ongoing festivals  
- **Enhanced Context**: Better recommendations based on local celebrations

### ⚙️ **Issue 3: Removed Gemini Holiday Checkbox**

**Changes Made**:

#### **Settings Modal** (`src/components/Settings.tsx`):
- ✅ **Removed**: Holiday toggle checkbox
- ✅ **Replaced**: With "Always Active" information panel
- ✅ **Updated**: Interface to remove `enable_gemini_holidays`

#### **Server Logic** (`server/index.js`):
- ✅ **Removed**: Holiday enabling checks
- ✅ **Always Active**: Holiday context always included when Gemini key available
- ✅ **Simplified**: No more conditional holiday fetching

#### **New Settings Display**:
```
🎉 Holiday & Festival Integration [Always Active]

Holiday and festival information is now automatically included in all 
activity searches. The system considers local holidays, festivals, and 
cultural events when suggesting activities, including checking if 
attractions might be closed on public holidays.
