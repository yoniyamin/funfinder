# 🎪 Fever Events Integration - COMPLETE

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Your AI-powered kids activities finder now **fetches real events from Fever** and uses them to provide better, more accurate recommendations!

### 🎯 How It Works

**Before:** AI generated activity suggestions from general knowledge
```
User searches → AI invents activities → Recommendations
```

**After:** AI filters and curates real events based on your criteria
```
User searches → Fetch Fever events → AI filters by age/weather/etc → Recommendations
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. **Fever Event Scraper** (`server/fever-scraper.js`)
   - Scrapes real events from Fever's public pages
   - Supports 18+ cities (Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, London, NYC, etc.)
   - Extracts: title, URL, price, category, kid-friendliness
   - **Smart filtering**: Pre-filters adult content (bars, 18+ events)
   - **Caching**: 6-hour cache to avoid excessive scraping

### 2. **Enhanced AI Prompt** (`server/index.js`)
   - **New Mode**: When real events are available, AI switches to "curator mode"
   - **Selection Criteria**: 
     - ✓ Age appropriateness for specified kids' ages
     - ✓ Duration matching
     - ✓ Weather suitability
     - ✓ Date relevance
     - ✓ Family-friendly filtering
   
   - **AI Enrichment**: AI adds missing info (suitable ages, duration estimates, notes)
   - **Preserved URLs**: Real Fever booking links maintained

### 3. **Intelligent Fallback**
   - If Fever events found → AI filters from real events
   - If no Fever events or city unsupported → AI generates from general knowledge
   - **Zero disruption**: Existing behavior preserved for unsupported cities

### 4. **Caching System**
   - **SimpleCache**: In-memory fallback cache
   - **Neo4j Integration**: Uses existing dataManager if available
   - **Cache Duration**: 6 hours (balance between freshness & performance)

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Server Logs

✅ Loaded 30 real events from Fever for AI filtering
```

### 2. Check AI Prompt (Dev Tool)
In the results page, click **"View AI Prompt"** and you'll see:
```

  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Jurassic World The Experience Madrid",
    "category": "other",
    "price_from": 16.25,
    "free": false,
    "url": "https://feverup.com/es/madrid/plans/jurassic-world-the-experience",
    "suitable_for_kids": true
  },
  ...

const FEVER_CITY_SLUGS = {
  'your-city': { slug: 'city-slug', lang: 'en', country: 'us' },
  // Add more...
};
```

### Adjust Cache Duration
Edit `server/fever-scraper.js`:
```javascript
const cacheDuration = 6 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // Change 6 to desired hours
```

### Change Event Limit
Edit `server/index.js` (line ~3805):
```javascript
realEvents = formatEventsForAI(feverEvents, 30); // Change 30 to desired limit
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Events Not Being Fetched
**Check:**
1. City name spelling matches `FEVER_CITY_SLUGS`
2. Internet connection working
3. Fever website accessible
4. Server logs for error messages

**Fix:**
- Scraping is **best-effort** - if it fails, AI generates normally
- Check `⚠️ Fever events fetch failed` in logs for details

### Wrong Events Showing Up
**Possible causes:**
1. AI misinterpreting event suitability
2. Event titles unclear

**Fix:**
- Review AI prompt (click "View AI Prompt")
- Adjust `SELECTION CRITERIA` in `buildUserMessage()`
- Improve kid-friendliness detection in `inferKidFriendly()`

### Performance Issues
**If scraping is slow:**
- Increase cache duration (default 6 hours)
- Reduce event limit (default 30)
- Check network latency
